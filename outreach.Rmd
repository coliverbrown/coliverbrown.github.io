title: "Outreach"

One of the greatest parts of my job as a curatorial assistant is public reach. I enjoy being an ambassador of the museum and explaining how museum research helps us understand the world. In my time at UAMN, I have volunteered at a couple of open house events and was interview for an article in the local paper, the *Fairbanks Daily News-Miner*.

Additionally, I have participated in the [Letters to a Pre-Scientist program](https://prescientist.org/) since 2022. In this program, I sent four letters to a middle school student to discuss being a STEM professional and encourage them to pursue a career in STEM.
