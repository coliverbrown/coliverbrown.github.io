My name’s Caitlyn Oliver Brown and I’m a graduate student at University of Alaska Fairbanks working toward my M.Sc. in Biology. My research focuses on population divergence between avian populations in Beringia and local adaptation in Alaskan Song Sparrow subspecies. I earned a B.Sc. in Biology, Ecology and Evolution at San Jose State University, where I analyzed the phenotypic differences in Clark’s Nutcracker museum specimens. 

In between undergrad and graduate school, I worked on multiple seasonal field jobs with both mammals and birds. I trapped and collared mule deer fawns and Greater Sage-Grouse and worked independently to set up ARUs to track California Spotted Owls.

I am passionate about science communication and outreach. Broadly, I’m interested in avian evolution, genomics, and museum collections. I am currently looking towards earning a PhD for a career in academia, hopefully as a museum curator.
