I am a biologist interested in avian evolution and museum specimens. I graduated from San José State University (SJSU) with a B.S. in Biology, with a concentration in ecology and evolution in 2019. After graduating from SJSU, I worked three field seasons as a research technician. I worked on mule deer, Greater Sage-Grouse, and California Spotted Owls. Though I enjoyed working in the field, I longed to return to museum work.

After two years of field work, I began a Master's program at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF). I worked with [Dr. Kevin Winker](https://www.kevinwinker.org/), the curator of birds at the University of Alaska Museum of the North. My Master’s thesis examined gene flow, divergence, and local adaptation in Beringian birds. While at UAF, I worked as a Curatorial Assistant, collecting and preparing bird specimens. 

Currently, I am a PhD student at the University of New Mexico in the [Andersen Lab](https://www.andersenlabunm.org/). I’m also a [Museum Research Trainee](https://mrt.unm.edu/). I hope to use phylogenomics to study the biogeography of island systems.
