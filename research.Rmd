Broadly, I am interested in avian evolution, speciation, and phylogenomics. To answer these questions, I employ genomics and museum specimens. My Master's thesis used Beringia as a model to understand divergence between avian populations.

### *Melospiza melodia* subspecies of Alaska
With over 5 recognized subspecies, the Song Sparrow complex of Alaska provides a unique way to study local adaption and variation. Song Sparrows occur across southern Alaska from Attu Island to southeast Alaska, and from west to east these populations demonstrate striking body size differences (larger-to-smaller) and a change from a sedentary to a migratory/partially migratory life-history strategy. We looked at both phenotypic and genomic variation to examine local adaptation in Alaska. Preprint is available at [biorxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.21.595201v1).
